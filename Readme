I only developed parts of this game.  This is for the Codecademy project learning phaser course.
Codecademy creates backbone (game does not function, but images, and css is already applied), and guides me in what functions should be built to create the game logic.
Extras (extras our not guided, but idea recommendations are sometimes provided): I added the "i" key and function.
